# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python â€“ Aseda Book Club

This is a collaborative African Book Club initiative where we study Automate the Boring Stuff with Python in our bi-weekly meetings. The goal is to create a supportive learning environment for Africans who are new to programming.

Every two weeks, we:

Read and discuss chapters from the book.

Share knowledge and explain concepts to one another.

Do short exams and presentations to strengthen our understanding.
